     The structure of the Statistics ontology follows the same principles as the <a href="https://w3id.org/def/exekg-ml">ML ontology</a>. The difference is the contents of the lower level sub-classes which in this case consist of tools for Statistics, such as functions that perform normalization, scattering, and trend and mean calculation.
