The DS (Data Science) ontology is the upper level ontology to which the rest refer. It represents the general concepts of Data Science. Particularly, it contains the upper level `owl:Class` entities which are colored with blue: _Data_, _Method_, and _Task_. The _Data_ class includes all concepts related to data, such as _DataSemantics_, which describes the meaning of data, and _DataStructure_, which specifies the format of data e.g., a _TimeSeries_ has the format _Array_. The _AtomicMethod_ class includes algorithms and functions (with allowed input, output, and parameters) that operate on data. The _Task_ class has two sub-classes: _AtomicTask_ and _Pipeline_. The first one defines the pipeline's tasks, that execute the mentioned functions. The second is an ordered series of such tasks that organize the movement of data. In addition to these classes, there are constraints that apply to certain data, such as the requirement that an _Array_ must have a certain number of dimensions.</span>
