The DS (Data Science) ontology is the upper level ontology to which the rest refer. It represents the general concepts of Data Science. Particularly, it contains the upper level <code>owl:Class</code> entities which are colored with blue: <i>Data</i>, <i>Method</i>, and <i>Task</i>. The <i>Data</i> class includes all concepts related to data, such as <i>DataSemantics</i>, which describes the meaning of data, and <i>DataStructure</i>, which specifies the format of data e.g., a <i>TimeSeries</i> has the format <i>Array</i>. The <i>Method</i> class includes algorithms and functions (with allowed input, output, and parameters) that operate on data. The <i>Task</i> class has two sub-classes: <i>AtomicTask</i> and <i>Pipeline</i>. The first one defines the pipeline's tasks, that execute the mentioned functions. The second is an ordered series of such tasks that organize the movement of data. In addition to these classes, there are constraints that apply to certain data, such as the requirement that an <i>Array</i> must have a certain number of dimensions.</span>
